## ANOVA 2: Taking your ANOVA skills a step further. 

**Has someone told you that you need to run a two-way ANOVA on your data but you have no idea how to do it? Then you are in the right place. This tutorial is a step by step guide on understanding what a two-way anova is, how to conduct a two-way ANOVA, understand and interpret the output of a two-way ANOVA and how to visualise the data for a scientific report.**    
   
**This tutorial is a continuation of Coding Club's [one-way ANOVA tutorial](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/anova/).  If you have not yet completed that tutorial I would recommend going through its contents first. It will help you understand the fundamentals of an ANOVA. This tutorial will take the knowledge gained from that one-way ANOVA tutorial one step further to compute a two-way ANOVA. The focus of this tutorial is on understanding the ANOVA output that we get in R.**

Note: This tutorial assumes that you know the basics on how to use Rstudio and how to write code. If you feel you need to remind yourself of the basics of Rstudio I recommend looking at the Coding Club tutorial [Intro to R](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/intro-to-r/).

### Learning outcomes:    
After completing this tutorial you should be able to:   
- run a two-way ANOVA
- understand and interpret the output of an ANOVA

### 1. Recap: What is an ANOVA and when do we use it   
Before we start this tutorial, let’s recap the basics of ANOVAs. From the one-way ANOVA tutorial we discovered that ANOVAs are widely used in ecological and environmental sciences and in many other domains.   
   
ANOVA stands for Analysis of Variance and is a way to assess whether the variation between the levels of categorical variables is higher than the variation within each level by determining if levels have significantly different means. By computing an anova we can find out whether differences are due to chance or not. 



<a name="section2"></a>
### 2. The difference between a one-way and a two-way ANOVA  
When we are using ANOVAs we are looking at the effect of one or more categorical variables on a continuous response variable. The type of ANOVA depends on the number of categorical explanatory variables. We know that when we have one categorical explanatory variable, we have a single factor design and we would have to conduct a one-way ANOVA.    
   
If we look at the diagram below we see that when we have two-categorical explanatory variables, we have to conduct a two-way ANOVA. If we had more than two-categorical variables we would need a multi-factorial ANOVA. Now you might have just realized that your explanatory variable is not categorical but continuous. In that case you would need to use a linear regression.  I recommend you take a look at the coding club tutorial [from distributions to linear models](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/modelling/).   

**This diagram shows how to decide on the right model for your data:**

### 3. Context of this tutorial    
Imagine you are really interested in agriculture and food security and you want to know what way of growing tomaotes gives the greatest yield. So, you have decided to conduct a study to compare the yield in greenhouses and in fields and whether this interacts with the type of fertilizer used.   

You are trying to answer the following **research question:**   
### Does the effect of fertilizer on tomato yield depend on whether the tomato is grown in a field or in a greenhouse?   
You have taken observations from 10 greenhouses and 10 fields. You measure tomato yield for a greenhouse by randomly selecting 5 plants and then averaging the yield per plant. This gives you 1 measurement of yield without fertilizer, 1 with organic fertilizer and 1 with synthetic fertilizer which overall gives you a sample size of 60. The yield per plant is then converted into ton/ha to give you are more meaningful value.   

<img src="tomatoes.jpg" alt="drawing" width="500"/> 

*A photo I took of tomatoes I picked on an organic farm in La Puebla del Rio, in Andalusia (June 2022).*    
   
Let’s summarise what variables we have in this tutorial:
-	Continuous response variable: tomato yield (ton/ha)
-	1st categorical explanatory variable: treatment type, there are three different types of treatment which are no fertilizer, organic fertilizer and synthetic fertilizer so we have 3 levels
-	2nd categorical explanatory variable: location, the tomatoes are either grown in a greenhouse or in a field outside so we have 2 levels   
   
There are three questions we are trying to answer:   
(1)	Is there an effect of treatment type on tomato yield?   
(2)	Is there an effect of location on tomato yield?   
(3)	Is there an interacting effect of location and treatment type on tomato yield?    

Before running the model we should think about what outcome we predict. Which treatment do you think will have the highest yield? Do you think the yield will be higher in a greenhouse or in the field?   
Your hypothesis doesn’t have to be the same as mine as you might have different ideas why it may vary. Write down your hypothesis and predictions now.

These are my predicitons:
-  Hypothesis 1: The tomato yield will be highest with synthetic fertilizer as this adds a lot of nutrients into the soil to help the plants grow.
-	Hypothesis 2: The tomato yield in the greenhouse will be the highest because there is less competition and temperatures are warmer.
-	Hypothesis 3: The effect of treatment will depend on where the tomatoes are grown.

### 4. Data wrangling   
To get started with R, you need to download the data for this tutorial from [this repository](https://github.com/EdDataScienceEES/tutorial-rebeccah2202). Click on `Code/Download Zip` and unzip the folder. The data you will need is the tomatoes.csv file.    
Now open Rstudio and start a new script.   
   
 - set working directory   
If you are working in a GitHub repository, the easiest is to add the tomatoes.csv file to your repo. In that case you won’t have to set your working directory and you can use relative file paths to detail where your data is saved.   
    
If you have never heard of GitHub before, don’t despair you don’t need it to complete this tutorial. If you are interested in learning how to use GitHub check out coding club’s [GitHub tutorial](link). If not, you should set you working directory to the location where your data is saved. Use the `setwd()` function to do this.   

```r
# set working directory
setwd("C:/Users/rebec/Documents/data science/tutorial-rebeccah2202/script")
```

 - load data   
Now that we have downloaded our data let’s load it into our environment in R. Using the code below we are loading in our data and calling the dataframe `tomatoes`.
 
```r
# load data ----
tomatoes <- read.csv("~/data science/tutorial-rebeccah2202/data/tomatoes.csv", sep=";")
```

 - load libraries   
In this tutorial we only need three packages which are `dpylr` for data manipulation, `tidyr` to tidy data and `ggplot2` for data visualisation. You can load these packages using the `library()` function. 

```r
# load libraries ----
library(dplyr)    # efficient data manipulation
library(tidyr)    # tidying data
library(ggplot2)  # visualising data
```

 - exploring and tidying dataset

Now that we have loaded in our data, let’s explore the dataset. We can do this using the `head()` function which gives us a snippet of the first few lines of the dataset. 
```r
# Exploring data set ----
head(tomatoes)
```
   
We can see that we have 5 columns: replicates, location, no fertilizer, organic fertilizer and synthetic fertilizer. This shows that there are several measurements of yield in the same row e.g. three measurements of yield in each row. Our data is currently in the wide format and we want to convert it into the long format. We can do this using the `gather()` function. We reshape the data by telling R to create one column which we will call treatment and one column which we will call yield. We have to specify from where R should take the numbers so we specify columns three to five like this: `3:5`. 
   
```r
# Data manipulation ----
# reshaping data into long form
long <- gather(tomatoes, "treatment", "yield", 3:5)
```

Let’s have a look at what type of data we have using the str() function.
```r
str(long)
```
We see that location and treatment are characters but we want them to be factors with different levels as they are categorical explanatory variables. We can easily change them using the `mutate()` function. Then check again. You should see that our explanatory variable indeed has 3 levels: no fertilizer, organic fertilizer and synthetic fertilizer. Our explanatory variable location has two levels, field and greenhouse.

```r
long <- long %>%
  mutate(across(c(treatment, location), as.factor))

# check again
str(long)
```


<a name="section5"></a>
### 5. Visualising data   
To undertsand what data we are dealing with and to visualise the differences between categories and levels, it can be helpful to visualise the data using a boxplot before actually starting the analysis. We are going to make a very basic boxplot using ggplot. Our x variable is the explanatory variable treatment and our y variable is our continous response variable y. We want the colours in the boxplot to represent the different locations (greenhouse/field), which we define with `fill=location`.
   
```r
# make a basic boxplot to visualise data using ggplot ----
(boxplot1 <- ggplot(long, aes(x = treatment, y = yield,
                              fill = location)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs (title = "Yield of tomatoes varies with treatment types and location"))

# save boxplot
ggsave(boxplot1, file = "figures/yield_boxplot.png", width = 9, height = 6)
```
   
We can now see that the field measurements are coloured in red and the greenhouse measurements in blue. From the graph you should also be able to see that the yield is highest for synthetic fertilizer and lowest with no fertilizer. Overall, the yield tends to be higher in the greenhouse compared to the field. However, we see that the boxplots overlap and we cannot be sure that these differences are significant or if they could be due to chance. To check this, we can now compute a two-way ANOVA to see if the differences in yield are actually significant. 
   
<img src="/figures/yield_boxplot.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>





<a name="section6"></a>
### 6. Computing two-way ANOVA and understanding the output   

- **ANOVA using `aov`**   
   
Now we are getting to the important stuff. How do we compute our two-way ANOVA in R. This is very similar to a one-way ANOVA, the structure and syntax are the same. If we were only looking at the effect of treatment on yield the model would look like this:   
`aov(yield ~ treatment, data = long)`   
This should be familiar to you from the one-way ANOVA tutorial. Now the only difference, when we are conducting a two-way ANOVA is that we are adding in an interaction term `*` and a second categorical explanatory variable `location`.  

```r
# two-way ANOVA ----
model_1 <- aov(yield ~ treatment * location, data = long)
summary(model_1)
```

We can now look at the output using the `summary()` function:
<img src="/figures/model_1.png" alt="drawing" width="700"/>

This is looking slightly more complicated than the output from a one-way ANOVA. Before we go through each line individually, let's remind ourselves of what each column represents.   
`Df`: The degrees of freedom = the number of values that have the freedom to vary    
`Sum Sq`: The sum of squares = a measure of variation from the mean     
`Mean Sq`: The mean squares =  obtained by dividing the sum of squares by the corresponding degrees of freedom giving us an average variation for each factor    
`F value`: The F value = ratio of variation between groups and variation within groups   
`Pr(>F)`: The P value = probability of obtaining an F-ratio as large or larger than the one observed    
   
**Line 1:**   
The first line gives us information on the effect of **treatment**. 
In last column we can read off the p-value which is 1.21e-09. Now you may be thinking what is this e and how am I supposed to know whether it is below 0.05. Lucky you because R indicates it's significance using `*`. We can see that there are three stars which indicates that the **p-value is below a threshold  of 0.001**. You can see this from the significance codes given below the table.   
   
**Line 2:**    
The second line gives us information on the effect of **location**.
As with the effect of treatment, we can see that location has three stars indicating that the **p-value is below a threshold  of 0.001**.   
   
**Line 3:**   
The third line gives us information on **the interaction between treatment and location** indicated with the `:`. We can see that the p-value is 0.00281 which is below 0.01 and is thus below the 0.05 threshold of statistical significance. 
   
**Line 4:**    
The fourth line represents the variation within levels, described as residual variance.    
   

To summarise, our model output shows us that:   
(1) there is a significant difference in yield between the treatment types   
(2) there is a significant difference in yield between the locations   
(3) there is a significant interaction between the treatment and location 

Well done for getting this far! I know statistics involve a lot of thinking and brain power.   
    
To get more information, we are now going to run the anova using a linear model function. If you are happy with the outputs we have done so far and feel like adding more complexity is too much for you at this point, you can skip directly to the next section: <a href="#section7"> 7. Checking assumptions</a>    
   
- **ANOVA using `lm`**   
Remember *an ANOVA is a linear model* so you could also use the `lm()` function to model the same relationship. We don't have to change any of the code in parentheses, the only part of the code that we will change, is replacing the `aov` with `lm`. Let's also compute some summary statistics of the mean of each level which will help  in understanding the output of the linear model. We will use to `group_by()` function combined with the `summarise()` function to do this:  
   
```r
model_2 <- lm(yield ~ treatment * location, data = long)
summary(model_2)

# means of each level
summary <- long %>% group_by(treatment, location) %>%
  summarise(mean_value = mean(yield))
```

*Model output*   
<img src="/figures/lm_output.png" alt="drawing" width="1000"/>

*Means of levels*   
<img src="/figures/summary_data.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>


This output looks a lot more confusing than the output from the ANOVA. You may be thinking what is meant by intercept, why are some of my levels not in the ouput?? Feelings of confusion are completely normal. Outputs from interaction models can be quite daunting at first, but we will go through it step by step to make it clearer. 
   
The first thing to explain is that an ANOVA uses the level that comes alphabetically first as the intercept. The other values are then relative to the intercept. Now you may think why would R do this? Doesn't this make it more complicated than it already is? It may make it more difficult for us to interpret but the reason R does this is to save statistical power. Statistcal power is the probability that we correctly reject the null hypothesis. The concept of statistical power can be confusing so I won't go into any more detail now. Just remember that R replaces the intercept with a coefficient for an important reason.   

Now let's go through the output of our model step by step. You don't need to understand every single value in the table to understand the output, so we will focus on the important parts. Every line is explained seperately as indicated in the figure.    
   
**Line 1:**   
`(Intercept)`: We can see that both organic and synthetic fertilizer are given in the rows below, so we know that the level no fertilizer has been set as the reference level. This first line gives us an estimate of the  (yield) baseline value: the yield with no fertilizer grown in the field which is 90.533.   
   
**Line 2:** 
`treatmentorganic_fertilizer`: How much higher is the yield with organic fertilizer in the field compared to no fertilizer in the field (intercept)? The yield is 4.794 ton/ha higher which is not significant.    
Yield in the field with organic fertilizer - calculation: 90.533 + 4.794 = 95.327  - we can compare this value to the summary table and see that it is the same

**Line 3:**
`treatmentsynthetic_fertilizer`: How much higher is the yield with synthetic fertilizer in the field compared to no fertilizer in the field (intercept)? The yield is 27.955 ton/ha higher which is significant.   
Yield in the field with synthetic fertilizer - calculation: 90.533 + 27.955 = 118.488   
   
**Line 4:** 
`locationgreenhouse`: How much higher is the yield with no fertilizer in the greenhouse compared to no fertilizer in field (intercept)? The yield is 10.300 ton/ha higher which is not statistically significant.   
Yield in greenhouse with no fertilizer - calculation: 90.533 + 10.300 = 100.833  

Okay, you have made it through the first four lines! That wasn't too bad was it?
   
Remember that we are trying to understand the interaction between treatment type and location. The last two lines look at **interactions as indicated with the `:`**   
     
**Line 5:** 
`treatmentorganic_fertilizer:locationgreenhouse`: **Does the effect of organic fertilizer on yield significantly change when used in a greenhouse?**           
The effect of the interaction of organic fertiliser and greenhouse increases the yield by 16.590 ton/ha which is not significant.   
**Note that this is NOT the effect of organic fertilizer and greenhouse on yield but merely the effect of organic fertilizer on yield when used in a greenhouse.**   
Yield in the greenhouse with organic fertilizer - calculation: 90.533 + 4.794 + 10.300 + 16.590 = 122.217    
    
**Line 6:** 
`treatmentsynthetic_fertilizer:locationgreenhouse`: **Does the effect of synthetic fertiliser on yield significantly change when used in a greenhouse?**   
The effect of using synthetic fertiliser in a greenhouse increases the yield by 50.050 ton/ha which is significant.    
**Again this is NOT the effect of synthetic fertilizer and greenhouse on yield but the effect of organic fertilizer on yield when used in a greenhouse.**
Yield in greenhouse with synthetic fertilizer - calculation: 90.533 + 27.955 + 10.300 + 50.050 = 178.838   
   
Conclusions:   
The tomato yield in the field is significantly higher with synthetic fertilizer than with no fertilizer.   
   
The effect of synthetic fertiliser on tomato yield significantly increases when applied in a greenhouse compared to using the synthetic fertilizer in the field.

### 7. Checking assumptions
When we have ran our model it is essential to check whether our model fulfills the assumptions of an ANOVA.   

**There are three assumptions:**   

**1. All observations are indepedent**   
If we want to know whether our observations are independent we should think about our experimental design and what independent observations actually means. Independent data points suggests that our individual measurements are unconnected an therefore the measure of one value will not give you an indication of the value of another measurement. When the values are not independent from one another then we call this **pseudoreplication**.    
An example of pseudorelication is when the individuals we are measuring have a common environment. For example, if we were only sampling tomato plants from one greenhouse and one field and treating each plant as an independent measurement then this would be pseudoreplication as they share the same environment. But as mentioned before, we are calculating the mean of the plants in the same greenhouse and then comparing this to the mean yield in a different greenhouse. Therefore, we can assume that our measurements are indeed independent. 


**2. The residuals are normally distributed**   
We can visualy assess wether the residuals are normally distributed by plotting a histogram of the residuals and by plotting a normal Q-Q plot using the `plot` function in R. Run the following code and then take a look at the plots we get.
```r
# check assumptions ----
# are residuals normally distributed?
hist_res <- hist(model_1$residuals)

# normal Q-Q
plot_normal <- plot(model_1, which = 2)
```   
From the histogram we can see that the residuals are normally distributed. The normal Q-Q plot also indicates whether the residuals are normally distirbuted or not. If the residuals are all on one line (indicated with the dotted line), then they are normally distributed. From the graph, we can see that most of the points are on the line.   
   
<img src="/figures/histres.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>    <img src="/figures/normalQQ.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

**3. The variances of the residuals in different groups are the same**     
The next plot we are making is the residual vs fitted plot. This plot is used to assess whether we have equal variance. If the red line is flat then the variances of the residuals in different groups are the same. We can see that the red line is not perfectly flat which could be caused by the outliers points 20, 24 and 30. These outliers may affect the assumption of normality and equal variance. But you can only remove outliers if you have a **valid reason**. 
```r
# residuals vs fitted
plot_res_vs_fit <- plot(model_1, which = 1)
```
<img src="/figures/res_vs_fit.png" alt="drawing" width="600"/>



<a name="section8"></a>

### 8. Tu(r)key test   
You may still be thinking that you have not found out everything you wanted to know.  The ANOVA output showed us that there is a significant difference between the means of treatment levels and locations and that there is a significant interaction. But we don't actually know which treatment types and interactions are significantly different from each other. How do the effects of different treatment compare to each other? For example: Does synthetic fertilizer give a higher yield than organic fertilizer?  
   
To identify this we can run a post-hoc test: Tukey test   
This is a multiple pairwise-comparisons that compares all means and identifies which differences between means are significant. Personally, I think the best way to remember the name of this pairwise-comparison is by thinking of it as being very similar to the word turkey. But don't forget to remove the r when typing the code because unfortunately R  will not understand and you will get an error message. 
   
<img src="/figures/turkey.jpg" alt="drawing"/> *Image of a turkey taken by Joel Sartore for The National Geographic*
   
Let's first look at which treatment types have significantly different means: Is there a significant effect in treatment between all levels? To run the Tukey test we use the function `TukeyHSD`.
```r
# Tukey test ----
# Tukey test to compare significance of different levels of treatment
# Is the difference in treatment significant between all levels?
TukeyHSD(model_1, which = "treatment", conf.level=.95)
# we see that between no fertilizer and organic fertilizer there is actually NOT a significant difference
```
After running the code you should get the following output from the Tukey test. There are three lines because we are comparing the means of three different treatment groups, giving us three comparisons:   
(1) organic fertilizer vs no fertilizer   
(2) synthetic fertilizer vs no fertilizer   
(3) synthetic fertilizer vs organic fertilizer   
   
<img src="/figures/tukey_treat.png" alt="drawing" width="900"/>    
The Tukey test gives us an adjusted p-value as indicated with `p adj` in the output. The p-value is adjusted to reflect that multiple comparisons are being made. If we don't use an adjusted p-value, then the probability of getting a type 1 error increases. From line 1 we can see that there is not a significant difference between adding no fertilizer and adding organic fertilizer to the tomato plants. This shows, that even though there is a significant difference of treatment type overall, the difference is not significant between all levels.

Now let's have a look at which interactions are significant:
```r
TukeyHSD(model_1, which = "treatment:location", conf.level=.95)
```
   
When we run the Tukey test again, this time specifying the interaction using `treatment:location` we get the following output:   
<img src="/figures/tukey_treat_loc.png" alt="drawing" width="900"/>   
   
HELP?? Why does the output have so many lines and numbers.     
Take a deep breath, make a cup of tea and come back with a calmer mind.   
   
Ready?   
   
Great, we will only look at the two lines that correspond to the model output from the linear model.
    
**Line 8:**   
This line compares the difference in yield between using **organic fertilizer in the field and in the greenhouse**. We can see that the difference is 26.89 which is the same difference that we would get from the linear model if we added together the effect of location greenhouse with the interacting effect of organic fertilizer with greenhouse. This difference gives us a **p-value = 0.0914**. This is above the 0.05 threshold and therefore not statistically significant. 

**Line 12:**
This line compares the difference in yield between using **synthetic fertilizer in a greenhouse or in a field**. The estimated difference is 60.35 which gives us a **significant p-value of 0.0000020**.

### 9. How to report results   
Now that we have run our ANOVA model, checked its assumptions and conducted a post-hoc test, we can think about how to visualise our results. We could present our results using a boxplot as visualised earlier on in the tutorial. However, the boxplot we designed earlier used the default ggplot settings which is not really suitable for a scientific report. 

This is a list of essential things that need to be changed about our original boxplot to make it suitable for a scientific report:
- we should remove the default grey background and grid lines
- make axis text bigger and bold so that it is clearly visable
- don't forget to add the units in the axis titles
- remove figure title (Figures in papers should never have titles!!)
- add a figure legend to our boxplot

An optional change:
- change colours to your preference

For more detailed explanations on data visualisation check out the [beautiful and informative data visualisation tutorial](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/datavis/) or if you want to take your data visualisation skills to the next level, the [tutorial customising your figures](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/data-vis-2/) may be the one for you.

```r
# final boxplot
(boxplot2 <- ggplot(long, aes(x = treatment, y = yield,
                             fill = location)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("#96CDCD", "#43CD80", "#FFFFFF")) +  
    labs(x = "\ntreatment", y = "yield ton/ha",  
         caption = "\nFigure 1: The figure shows the effect of different treatment types on tomato yield in the field and greenhouse. 
The highest yield was in plots with synthetic fertilizer in the greenhouse. There was an interaction between 
treatment and location, so the effect of treatment on tomato yield depends on the location (n=60).") +
    theme_classic() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),        
          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
          axis.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),  
          panel.grid = element_blank(),
          legend.text = element_text(size = 12),  
          legend.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),  
          legend.position = "right",
          plot.caption = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0)))

# save final boxplot
ggsave(boxplot2, file = "figures/yield_boxplot2.png", width = 9, height = 6)
```
We can see that our second boxplot is much more suitable for a scientific report than the first one.
